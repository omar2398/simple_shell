history: history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or history -awrn [filename] or history -ps arg [arg...]

     Display the history list with line numbers.  Lines listed with
     with a `*' have been modified.  Argument of N says to list only
     the last N lines.  The `-c' option causes the history list to be
     cleared by deleting all of the entries.  The `-d' option deletes
     the history entry at offset OFFSET.  The `-w' option writes out the
     current history to the history file;  `-r' means to read the file and
     append the contents to the history list instead.  `-a' means
     to append history lines from this session to the history file.
     Argument `-n' means to read all history lines not already read
     from the history file and append them to the history list.

    If FILENAME is given, then that is used as the history file else
    if $HISTFILE has a value, that is used, else ~/.bash_history.
    If the -s option is supplied, the non-option ARGs are appended to
    the history list as a single entry.  The -p option means to perform
    history expansion on each ARG and display the result, without storing
    anything in the history list.

    If the $HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set and not null, its value is used
    as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated
    with each displayed history entry.  No time stamps are printed otherwise.
