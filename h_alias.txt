alias: alias [-p] [name[=value] ... ]

   `alias' with no arguments or with the -p option prints the list
    of aliases in the form alias NAME=VALUE on standard output.

    Otherwise, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE is given.
    A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked for
    alias substitution when the alias is expanded.

    Alias returns true unless a NAME is given for which no alias has been defined.
