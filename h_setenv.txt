setenv: setenv [VAR][VALUE]

change the value  or add an a new environment variable and its value


       The setenv() function adds the variable name to the environment with
       the value value, if name does not already exist.  If name does exist
       in the environment, then its value is changed to value if overwrite
       is nonzero; if overwrite is zero, then the value of name is not
       changed (and setenv() returns a success status).  This function makes
       copies of the strings pointed to by name and value (by contrast with
       putenv(3)).
